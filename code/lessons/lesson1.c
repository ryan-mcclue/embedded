 * Embedded system special-purpose. More restrictions/constraints in software (deterministic, real time), 
 * hardware (speed, code, ram), debugging (limited hardware breakpoint timing errors), 
 * mass deployment/maintanence
 * Learning a new MCU is like a new programming language (a DSP can be another name for an MCU)
 * Schematic first. Larger component, generally more important
 * Embedded systems is a team sport of EE and software. 
 * Could be bug in software or hardware (power supply failing, failed to get cpu errata).
 * Therefore, most embedded systems difficult as you often only know half
 * Embedded systems interact with our world, not just our screens

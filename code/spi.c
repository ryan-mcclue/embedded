// NOR flash is cheaper and slower than NAND.
// often NOR uses SPI, QSPI instead of parallel interfaces

// QSPI uses 4 data lines instead of 2 (quad-spi, i.e. queued spi)
//
// debouncing in software although more involved than a hardware capacitor, allows for say holding/releasing button for x amount of time

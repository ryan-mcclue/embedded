  // 3 low power modes (usage, startup time, activity)
  // (REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE OF CLOCK SOURCES)
  // 1. sleep: CPUCLK shuts off

  //           HAL_ResumeTick();
  //           However, seems more flexible to use an interrupt (WFI) to wakeup, e.g. timer, SPI bus data etc.
  // 2. stop: most CLKS off, i.e. all peripheral clocks off (if using WFI, can only use EXTI)
  //          no need to explicitly suspend systick
  //          however, on resumption will have to system_intialise(), i.e. start clocks again
  // 3. standby: SRAM contents lost, most CLKS/oscillators off 
  //             will restart system on wakeup
  //             WFI must be on certain pin, e.g. WKUP pin
  //             still have power say on 3.3V pin
  //             can check if wakeup by inspecting backup registers
  //             TODO(Ryan): could also wakeup from watchdog or rtc

  // When you restart, you scan the memory to find the highest sequence number of a block with a valid CRC

  // red led indicates error, say for initialisation error

  // more accurate readings as direct clock source not PLL?
  // XTAL are pins for external oscillator (on boards, X labels oscillator)
  // RTC stores date, like day of week etc.
  // for accurate, i.e. mininmal drifting stm32 rtc, want it to be clocked with LSE (as its at 32.768KHz which is a sweet spot?) 
  // the LSI is not as accurate? meaning crystal frequency varies?
  // why want low frequency as compared to say HSE?
  // IMPORTANT: LSE must be enabled via RCC
  // RTC operates in backup domain, so on reset will retain (only if power still to VBAT, not necessarily whole system VCC?)
  // Will require initial setting to actual time
  //
  // Not all discovery boards have this on them, rather only have pads for you to solder your own cystal to
